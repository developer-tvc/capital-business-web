                      <b>How We Use Your Personal Data?</b><br />
                      We collect your personal data to ensure we provide you with the best service we possibly can. Capital Finserv Limited commits to respect and protect your privacy. We will never disclose, sell and share your data without your consent unless required to do so by law. The purpose and reasons why we collect your personal data are:<br />
                      1.	To assess, develop and improve the products and services we provide.<br />
                      2.	If you make an application for a loan, you confirm that all information provided by you is accurate and complete. You also agree for us to use your information to carry our credit assessment including checking credit history held by Credit Referencing Agencies.<br />
                      3.	To check your identity, assess your credit history,<br /> 
                      4.	To enter into a credit contract or to ensure the performance of your obligations under the contract<br />
                      <b>Information We collect from other sources</b><br /> 
                      1.	We may receive information about you if you make an enquiry about or apply for a loan or use any the other services which we provide. In this case, we will have informed you when we collected that data that it may be shared internally and combined with data collected on this site.<br /> 
                      2.	Fraud Prevention Agencies. In the event that you provide us with false or inaccurate information, and we have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud, we may share your information with a fraud prevention agency to create a digital footprint based on all available information associated with any attempt to commit fraud. Any information disclosed to a fraud prevention agency may be used by them for statistical analysis and disclosed to other organisations to prevent any further fraud or attempted fraud.<br />
                      3.	Credit Reference Agencies. We use credit reference agencies to help build a better understanding of your financial circumstances, but the information which they provide to us alone does not determine your eligibility (or otherwise) for a loan from us. The information which we collect from credit reference agencies relating to you is for our own use only. We will notify credit reference agencies of any default of your obligations under any such contract with us and/or your loan being referred for legal collection. We only use UK-based credit and fraud agencies and do not disclose any of your information to any third party companies outside the United Kingdom or otherwise in a manner which does not comply with the GDPR and DPA. <br />
                      In order to process your application, we will perform credit and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (“CRAs”). Where you take financial services from us we may also make periodic searches at CRAs to manage your account with us.<br /> 
                      To do this, we will supply your personal information to CRAs and they will give us information about you. This will include information from your credit application and about your financial situation and financial history. CRAs will supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit, financial situation and financial history information and fraud prevention information.<br /> 
                      <b>We will use this information to: </b><br />
                      a.	Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product<br />
                      b.	Verify the accuracy of the data you have provided to us<br />
                      c.	Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering<br />
                      d.	Manage your account(s)<br />
                      e.	Trace and recover debts and<br />
                      f.	Ensure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances<br />
                      We will continue to exchange information about you with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We will also inform the CRAs about your settled accounts. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs. <br />
                      When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.<br />
                      If you are making a joint application, or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we will link your records together, so you should make sure you discuss this with them, and share with them this information, before lodging the application. CRAs will also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.<br />
                      The identities of the CRAs, their role as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods and your data protection rights with the CRAs are explained in more detail within the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN).<br />

                      •	This decision is based on our credit scoring models which assess how likely you are to act while paying back any funds borrowed. This assessment will check on how you have paid similar accounts in the past<br />
                      Our credit scoring model uses three sources to ensure a fair and well informed outcome is achieved;<br />
                      •	The details you submit on your application form<br />
                      •	Information held and supplied from credit reference agencies<br />
